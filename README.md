Metronome

This is a basic metronome for musicians to keep a steady beat.

Technologies utilized:
Ruby 2.4.5
Rails 5.2.1
Javascript
React
Make_It_So gem
AWS

I made this application utilizing Rails because I  might want to add on features in the future such as storing practice times, tempos, etc.  For now, it is a functional basic metronome application.
